# This script passes the unit tests in:
#
#   https://github.com/mkropat/sh-realpath
#
# Which needs the following for the unit tests:
#
#   https://github.com/kward/shunit2
#
# I've also verified that the tests work under zsh. Note that you need to apply
# the following changes in order for the tests to run:
#
# * In shunit2, after the definition of __SHUNIT_CMD_ECHO_ESC, add:
#
#       setopt shwordsplit
#
# * In each of the tests under t/, add the following at the top of the file:
#
#       SHUNIT_PARENT=$0
#
# * In this script, include the following line before the `echo` line. The
# tests want directories to end with '/', but my usage of this facility
# doesn't.
#
#       [ -d "$result" ] && result="$result/"
